# Weaver Solver

## Description
The **Weaver Solver** is a console-based game that challenges players to transform a starting word into an ending word by changing one letter at a time. Each intermediate word must be a valid word from a dictionary. The program extends upon the first one (Weaver), and implements a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between the two words.

## Features
- Specify the number of letters in the words.
- Input a starting word and an ending word, or generate random words.
- Validate input words against a dictionary.
- Display the solution path if one exists.

## Requirements
- **C Compiler**: A C compiler such as GCC or Clang.
- **Operating System**: Windows (developed using CLion).
- **Words File**: A `words.txt` file containing valid words of the desired length.

## Instructions
- Enter the number of letters for the words you want to use.
- Provide a starting and ending word or input 'r' for random words.
- The program will display the solution path if it exists.
- Choose to solve another puzzle, change the word length, or exit the program.

### Enjoy!
